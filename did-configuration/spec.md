## Abstract

Let's face it, other tools and generators for writing technical specifications aimed at standards bodies or industry groups are cumbersome, underwhelming, and lack the features you might want in a technical specification document. Spec-Up's goal is to deliver you a better spec-writing experience with far less effort and tedium than other tools in the ecosystem. Spec-Up is a dead simple tool that auto-generates great specs from markdown. The version of markdown Spec-up uses contains all the same features you might expect from common implementations, like GitHub, but adds much more, including notice blocks, complex tables, charts, advanced syntax highlighting, UML diagrams, etc.

## Getting Started

Using Spec-Up is easy peasy lemon squeezy:

1. `npm install spec-up`
2. Create a subdirectory in your project with two files:
   - `spec.json` - add some basic config values, like your desired HTML page title, etc.
   - `spec.md` - write the markdown version of your spec here (duh)
3. In your main node.js file, drop in this bad boy: `require('spec-up')()`

Boom! That's it. Spec-Up will auto-detect the location of your spec files and auto-generate your spec's HTML version every time you hit save after editing your `spec.md` files. Did I mention you can have multiple specs located at any depth in your project and Spec-Up will crawl up in there and render all those specs like a damn boss? Well it does, because why the hell not.

## Feature Flexin

In addition to all the normal markdown support (things like headings, lists, etc.), which you can see in this example document and all over GitHub readme pages, Spec-Up integrates a ton of other useful features that make it easy to articulate your technical content. Let's checkout some of the goodies:

### Table of Contents

<-- You see that beautiful TOC over there to your left? (tap the header link to slide it out on mobile) Yeah, you don't need to do a damn thing, that just magically appears based on your use of `h2`, `h3`, and `h4` headings.
